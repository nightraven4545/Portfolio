# Portfolio
Welcome to my portfolio project! This repository houses the code for my web development class assignment, where I designed and built a personal portfolio using HTML and CSS. 
This is my portfolio project, created as a simple class assignment using HTML and CSS. The portfolio showcases my skills in web development and design, highlighting the projects and assignments I have completed during the course. It serves as a digital representation of my abilities and growth throughout the learning process.
